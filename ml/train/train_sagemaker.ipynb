    "Welcome to our end-to-end example of distributed image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode. In this demo, we will use the Amazon sagemaker image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode to fine-tune a pre-trained model (trained on imagenet data) to learn to classify a new dataset. This dataset was generated by taking videos of a beer glass being filled up in order to determine when the glass is full or not. See the code repo for the scripts used to generate this training set. \n",
