# Overview
Random little project hooking a kegerator up to Alexa &amp; controlling beer flow with a solenoid and a ML model. It's a bit over the top, but it was fun to make!

# Hardware

## Kegerator
I purchased a kegerator, a co2 tank, and two Cornelious (corny) kegs from a seller off Craigslist. These corny kegs are refillable which allowed me to fill them up with water first so that I could test out the solenoid & "plumbing" without wasting a bunch of beer. These pony kegs use ball locks instead of a typical tap so beware that you'll have to use a different coupler if you want to use the kegs that are typically purchased from wine & beer shops.
